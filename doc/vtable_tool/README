This is a messy hack I wrote to dump vtables in a non-PIC executable.

You need to generate a list of symbols in the format `$size $name` and place it in /tmp/symlist.
The elf format header is pretty useful here.

There's a pregenerated copy in this folder.

This is only here so you can reproduce the included vtable list. It's really awful and I'm ashamed of it.

To use it, preload it in to PAYDAY like BLT. If everything worked correctly, you'll get a huge list of vtables, if not it will explode.
