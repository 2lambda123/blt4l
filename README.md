BLT4L Readme
============

BLT4L is a part clean-room, part-line-by-line rewrite of BLT, the PAYDAY
2 Better Lua injecTor, for Linux. It is compatibile with all BLT mods,
presents the same API, and uses the same LUA base.

Installing
==========

You can install BLT4L in a few different ways. 
The quickest way is to clone this repository, and run `install.sh`.
This will work best on Debian, or a Debian derivative, such as SteamOS, as
it can help you install missing dependecies.

If you're on Arch Linux (or a derivative like Manjaro), you can install the AUR package
[blt4l](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/blt4l/). This package uses the new launcher script,
works with or without the Steam runtime, and will automatically install the base Lua if it's not present.

You can also find prebuilt copies under the [releases](https://github.com/blt4linux/blt4l/releases)
tab, or if you want to debug or modify BLT4L, you can build it manually.

Building & Manual Install
=========================

##### In order to build BLT4L, you will need:

* openssl 
* curl4-openssl (gnutls is NOT supported)
* zlib
* cmake
* a build tool chain (most distros have one preinstalled, or available in a build-essentials package)

##### Do the following:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
$ mkdir build 
$ cd build
$ cmake .. 
$ make
```

You should find the hook in your build folder, named `libblt_loader.so`.
You will need to set `LD_PRELOAD` for the PAYDAY2 process to find the
loader.

Next, you will need to copy a LUA mod base to your PAYDAY 2 folder (or whatever working directory you intend to run PAYDAY 2 in).
There is a symlink to the BLT LUA mod base (from the BLT4WIN submodule) under `lua/mods`. 

If you set everyting up correctly, you should be up and running with the BLT mod API in PAYDAY 2.

##### Additional work for SELinux users (e.g. Fedora users):

Because our hook writes to executable sections of payday2, SELinux doesn't like us (and it shouldn't).
In order to add an SELinux exception for the BLT Hook, you must do the following:

Run Payday2 with libblt_loader.so (It will crash, and SELinux will log the error)
```
$ sudo ausearch -c 'payday2_release' --raw | audit2allow -M my-payday2-hook
$ sudo semodule -i my-payday-hook.pp
```
