Move the contents of this folder in to your PAYDAY 2 folder, so that it looks like this:

    PAYDAY 2/
        mods/
        libblt_loader.so

Open Steam, and open the properties for PAYDAY 2. Select "Set Launch Options", and set it to:

    env LD_PRELOAD="$LD_PRELOAD $HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/PAYDAY 2/libblt_loader.so" %command%
